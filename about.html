            <p>Mathius Johnson has had a generous amount of experience and training in all aspects of landscape maintenance (hedging, pruning, weed control, lawn care, planting annuals/bulbs, pressure washing, etc), coupled with industry standard education in the Landscape Horticulture Red Seal program (3rd year apprentice). He has a keen interest in promoting sustainable gardens with permaculture, using clean products for plant care and applying an integrated pest management approach to provide suitable preventative measures in the effort to reduce the need for any pesticides or herbicides. Pictured to the left with Mathius is his most valuable gardener, Samuel. Sam is very proficient at weed control, moral support, and taking water breaks.</p>
